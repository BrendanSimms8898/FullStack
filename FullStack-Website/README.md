# 2021-CA298-master

Created for our CA298 module where we created a website Front end and Backend using the Django software and python 2.7

Usage:

python manage.py runserver (ran in the first Shop14 folder)

Note:
Django needs to be intstalled and the server must be ran within a Python 2.7 enviroment.
